<u><h1> Specification 1 </h1></u>
    <body>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
    In this challenge you are going to be exploring frequency analysis of large text files and producing a visual way
    of presenting your analysis results. Write a program that takes a large text file and perform a frequency analysis
    of the characters and words in that file. You should then present your findings visually using the python 2D graph
    plotting library, Matplotlib.
    </p>
     <h3>Brief Description</h3>
    <p>
    Within this specification, the code takes data and manipulates it, there are functions which has a word and
    character frequency counter. Data is manipulated by recompiling the file into all lower case and taking away
    punctuations. Then, produces a CSV file which works out the frequency of words. A bar graph is produced for the
    visualisation of the frequency of characters.
    </p>
    <h3>Objectives</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>Read in a .txt file and parse the content.</li>
    <li>Perform a frequency analysis of the characters and words in the text file.</li>
    <li>Output the frequency of the most occurring words in the text file to a CSV file.</li>
    <li>Present your frequency analysis of the characters visually using the Matplotlib plotting library.</li>
    <li>Produce a Markdown file in your repository directory that combines your findings in one place.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
