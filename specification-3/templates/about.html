<u><h1> Specification 3 </h1></u>
<body>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    In this challenge you are going to build a web application using a Python-based web framework. Flask is a common web
    framework that is easy to setup and allows extensibility. You are going to build a simple web application that
    presents the code written in the previous challenge specifications. The purpose of the web pages is to present the
    code neatly with some brief documentation explaining the purpose of the code. What you do here is entirely
    experimental and open for creativity, therefore you can make use of any external libraries for the presentation of
    your code. However, be sure not to 'feature creep'. This challenge is about your ability to investigate a Python
    web framework library and its applications rather than your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript abilities. I suggest looking
    through my guide on creating a simple web application that uses HTML templates. Do not host your web application on
    a public server.
</p>
<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<p>
    Within this specification, I have created a simple web application using Flask
    which has a home page that links to other pages through url_for. These other pages are the other specifications,
    the overview, objectives, and code for them are displayed on their own respective pages. I have made all web pages
    extend from a common template. This templates adds some features to the web page including a navigation bar, a
    sidebar, and adds some style to web page. The navigation bar includes links to different specification pages.
    Some of the layout template was derived from the javascript jquery bootstrap.
</p>
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Install the Python web-framework Flask.</li>
    <li>Produce a simple home page that links/routes to other pages that display your code.</li>
    <li>Produce a web page for each of the other specifications and present your code on them.</li>
    <li>Produce a brief description explaining what the code does and how it meets the objective of the specification.
    </li>
</ul>
