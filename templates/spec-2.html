    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In this challenge, you are going to be exploring image manipulation using the Pillow Python library. Write a
    program that modifies a selection of images of various sizes and file formats and converts them to JPEG thumbnails.
    Your program should allow the user to apply a selection of modifications to an image and then store the modified
    image. To be able to modify images in this way, you will have to make use of the Pillow Python library. This library
    is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL), so much of the existing functionality is still there, however, the
    library has been expanded further. After you completed the core features of the program, expand your program by
    experimenting with different features of the Pillow library and showing your results. For example, you could
    manipulate the specific RGB values of each pixel of an image. If applicable, make sure to discuss what features you
    have experimented with in your individual report.
