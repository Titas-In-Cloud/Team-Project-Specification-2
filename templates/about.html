    <h1> About specification 3 </h1>
<body>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    In this challenge you are going to build a web application using a Python-based web framework. Flask is a common web
    framework that is easy to setup and allows extensibility. You are going to build a simple web application that
    presents the code written in the previous challenge specifications. The purpose of the webpages is to present the
    code neatly with some brief documentation explaining the purpose of the code. What you do here is entirely
    experimental and open for creativity, therefore you can make use of any external libraries for the presentation of
    your code. However, be sure not to 'feature creep'. This challenge is about your ability to investigate a Python
    web framework library and its applications rather than your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript abilities. I suggest looking
    through my guide on creating a simple web application that uses HTML templates. Do not host your web application on
    a public server.
</p>
<h3>Brief Documentation</h3>
<p>
    Within this specification, I have created a simple web application which has a home page that links to other pages.
    These other pages are the other specifications, the information and code for them are displayed on their
    own respective pages. I have made all web pages extend from a common template. This templates adds some features to
    the web page including a navigation bar, a sidebar, and adds some style to web page. The navigation bar includes
    links to different specification pages. Some of the template was derived from the javascript jquery bootstrap.
    This web page also allows users to register and login their account to be able to modify the content on each of the
    pages. However, I did not want to make this section too complex as this was not required in the objectives of the
    specification.
</p>
<h3>Libraries and Packages</h3>
<p>
    The main libraries and packages used in the making of this web page includes:
<ul>
    <li>Flask</li>
    <li>SQLAlchemy</li>
    <li>Flask-WTF</li>
    <li>WTForms</li>
    <li>template-render</li>
