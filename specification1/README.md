### Specification 1

In this part of the program for specification 1, you must ensure that in configurations, "book.txt" and "frequencies.csv" are in the script parameters in order for the code to work.
You must check in the pipfile that you have the matplotlib package for the program to be able to produce a graph of the character frequencies for the book. You should also be sure to update the program with the csv plugin.
Running the code in main.py will simply produce a frequencies.csv file which contains the frequency of words in book.txt where all the words will be in lower case and have punctuation removed to eradicate the possibilities of repeated words so the program doesn't recognise the word as two separate words (eg "The" and "the"). It will also print out the frequency of characters including spaces and this will also be displayed in a bar chart.
If you delete the frequencies.csv file, run the code again and it will produce the file again.
My code has been written using python version 3.7.
