### Specification 4

In this challenge it is up to you to choose a Python library that
hasn't been mentioned before in the previous challenges and develop a
software artefact around that library. The software artefact should
make use of some of the skills you have learned so far in CSC1031,
CSC1032, CSC1033, and CSC1034 so that it clearly displays your
programming and theoretical abilities.

This challenge has complete creative freedom. Meaning, you can build
anything you like as long as it doesn't make use of an aforementioned
library in the previous challenges.

#### Objectives

* Investigate Python libraries to focus your solution around.
* Plan your solution before development.
* Develop your program solution.
* Test your program.

#### Learning Outcomes

* To be able to investigate a library's documentation page to produce
  code that satisfies the objective.
* To be able to refine your investigation and avoid obfuscation.
* To be able to produce a program that isn't centred around a problem
  specification, allowing you to be creative with your solution.
* To be able to manage your time effectively by clearly planning the
  project before development.

#### Concepts to consider

* Everything in CSC1031, CSC1032, CSC1033, CSC1034

#### Libraries to investigate

Here are some links to pages that rate the top used Python libraries;
be aware that not all libraries might be suitable due to density
and/or technical limitations.
